In this directory, please find a number of scripts that are used
to start various components in the tezos docker images.

These script snippets are not executed as files by /bin/sh, but rather
as a single line passed in via -c.

We also ask for the helm template system to be passed over the snippet
before it is inserted into the chart.

YAML ISSUES

    Because we are actually including this snippet into YAML as
    an indented blob, it is a requirement that the first character
    in the file is in column zero.

TEMPLATING

    Because the templating system is used, you can use any of the
    features provided.  Mostly, variable expansion, i.e.

	{{ .Values.expected_proof_of_work }}

    If you use braces within the file, you will have to escape them,
    though:

	{{ "{{" }}

SCRIPT SIZE LIMIT

    Each OS has limit on the number of bytes that can be passed to
    a command to be executed.  In some cases, this may be relatively
    small, but we should be able to assume that it's at least 64KB.
    So, be explicit, take care of all of the error cases, but do not
    write your great novel.

    In practice, you are unlikely to run into this limit, but it
    exists and so it must be mentioned.
