#
# When running bakers for a public net, you must provide your own secret keys.
# For non public networks you can change this setting to true, and deterministic
# keys will be generated for your nodes automatically. If a genesis block hash
# is not provided, that will also be generated. This is helpful for spinning up
# local testnets.

# - Public chains: Accounts do not get `is_bootstrap_baker_account` and
# `bootstrap_balance` fields.
# - Non-public chains: If you don't specify accounts needed by nodes, they can
#   be created deterministically via the above setting. If specifying, accounts
#   can be given a bootstrap balance and can also be configured to be bootstrap
#   baker accounts. Accounts with balances set to "0" will be imported by the
#   node but they will not be bootstrap accounts. If you don't set a bootstrap
#   balance, it will default to the `bootstrap_mutez` field above.

# Names of nodes should be consistent with their statefulset names but with
# an added suffix being the index of the node.
# Example: `baker_statefulset.name: tezos-baking-node` -> `nodes.baking.tezos-baking-node-0`
# These names with suffix are the
# `metadata.name` of the downward k8s API. They should be kebab case.
